# Colorectal-Cancer-Diagnosis-Model-with-CNN
This is a TUBITAK 2209 project to compare existing CNN architectures and develop a proposed ensemble model for the detection of colorectal cancer from colon histopathological images. Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook, and Pytorch were used. The project is complete and is currently being developed into an academic publication.
